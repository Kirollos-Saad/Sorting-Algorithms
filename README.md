# Sorting-Algorithms
### An implementation of some sorting techniques:
- insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Heap Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Hybrid sort with merge and selection Sorts
### Also in this code,you'll find two application on these sorting techniques
- Time comparison code to test the complexity and implementation time of these algorithms
- Finding Kth Element in Unsorted Array and a number K where k is smaller than the size of the array, using the Partition function implemented in quicksort

## Note:
To test sorting techniques, run sorting.py file  
To test time comparisons, run time_measure.py file  
To test kth_element, run kth_element.py file
