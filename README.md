# Sorting-Algorithms
### An implementation of some sorting techniques:
-insertion Sort
-Selection Sort
-Heap Sort
-Merge Sort
-Quick Sort
-Hybrid sort with merge and selection Sorts
### Also in this code,you'll find two application on these sorting techniques
1-Time comparison code to test the complexity and implementation time of these algorithms
2-Finding Kth Element in Unsorted Array and a number K where k is smaller than the size of the array, using the Partition function implemented in quicksort
